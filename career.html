            <div class="staff-paragraph">
                <p>My name is Yomaira Borrero and I am the Assistant Guest Services Manager here at The Brownwood Hotel & Spa. What I love the most about my job here is that I feel like I'm at home. I grew up in The Villages, and graduated from The Villages High School in 2008. I grew up here, left to go to college, started my own family, then came right back home. This job was the next level in my career, and The Brownwood Hotel and Spa, provided me the gateway I needed to succeed.</p>

                <p>In the day to day, I try to give my employees the very best of me. I provide a safe place for them to be able to talk, to vent, to brainstorm. I pride myself in being an awesome soundboard, and allowing my employees to feel empowered, and confident in whatever decision they may take.</p>

                <p>As a team member of The Brownwood Hotel and Spa, you can expect to be treated with respect and professionalism. To us, you are not just a number or a punch on the time card. You are a person. One that we value, and one that we want to see flourish and prosper to be the best version of yourself</p>
